# **Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and classify them into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns. Effective segmentation helps businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and boost revenue.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains various customer attributes such as:
- **Demographics** (Age, Gender, Income, etc.)
- **Purchase History** (Frequency, Spending Amount)
- **Engagement Metrics** (Online interactions, Click rates)

## **Approach**
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers  
   - Feature engineering and scaling  
   - Encoding categorical variables  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding customer behavior through visualizations  
   - Correlation analysis  

3. **Customer Segmentation Models**  
   - **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised segmentation  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering** to identify customer groups  
   - **DBSCAN** for density-based segmentation (optional)  

4. **Model Evaluation & Interpretation**  
   - **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score** for optimal clusters  
   - Visualization using **PCA & t-SNE**  

## **Results & Insights**
- Identified distinct customer groups based on spending behavior.  
- Insights for targeted marketing and personalized recommendations.  

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for implementation  

## **Future Improvements**
- Integration of **Deep Learning** for advanced segmentation.  
- Incorporation of **RFM Analysis** for better customer profiling.
